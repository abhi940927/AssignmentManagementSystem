## 💻 Tech Stack

**EduFlow** is built using a highly efficient, lightweight modern stack.

**Frontend:**
* HTML5 (Semantic Structure)
* Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+ for interactive logic)
* Advanced CSS3 (Custom Design System, CSS Variables, Glassmorphism, CSS Animations)

**Backend:**
* Node.js & Express.js (RESTful API Architecture)
* MongoDB Atlas (Cloud NoSQL Database)
* Mongoose (ODM for schema validation)

**AI & Auth Integrations:**
* **Groq API**: For incredibly fast, state-of-the-art LLM inference.
* **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** & **Bcrypt**: For secure user authentication and data encryption.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the EduFlow platform on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v16.x or higher recommended)
* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) account (or local MongoDB instance)
* [Groq API Key](https://console.groq.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShashankPandey304/Assignment_Evaluator.git
   cd Assignment_Evaluator
   ```

2. **Setup the Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory and add the following keys:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```

4. **Seed Initial Data (Optional)**
   You can populate the database with initial tutor data to get started quickly.
   ```bash
   node seed-tutors.js
   ```
   **Default Tutor Login (from seed file):**
   * Email: `tutor@eduflow.com`
   * Password: `tutor1234`

5. **Run the Application**
   Open a terminal and start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   node server.js
   ```

   The backend will typically start on `http://localhost:5000`.

   To access the frontend, you can serve the `frontend/` directory using any static file server, for example:
   ```bash
   # From the root directory
   npx serve frontend
   ```
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or your static server's address) to begin using the platform.
